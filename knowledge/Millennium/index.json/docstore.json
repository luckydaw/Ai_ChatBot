The Teller who uploads the transaction would be able to select the type of customer \u2013 It could either be an individual or a business. The transaction can be uploaded in two ways.\n\n\n\nInput methods \u2013 \n\n\n\nFile upload \u2013\n\n\n\nTransactions:\n\nPayment instructions for multiple transactions can be uploaded as a batch file (grouped by disbursing agent and/or country of disbursement). The payment instruction file needs to follow the ISO20022 format and must adhere to the mandatory requirements of each country.  (Only accessible to Teller) On upload the file needs to be validated and checked if the mandatory field requirements have been met. The file also needs to be checked to see if the transactions provided are for the chosen country and currency. If an error is found in any transaction, the entire file must be rejected. The reason for rejection must be displayed on the screen and an email must be sent to the teller with details of the error. \n\n\n\nUser:\n\nAny company with multiple users can upload all the user details as a batch file.

If it is a new customer, the registration process has to be completed before the transaction can be uploaded. If the customer already exists, the teller is shown the list of all past transactions of that customer and their respective beneficiaries. The Teller would then be able to select the customer and the corresponding details would be auto filled into the transaction entry form.\n\n\n\nTransaction Processing Flow- \n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of file upload, the payment instruction file is first validated against the mandatory field (need more info on ISO20022 schema) requirements of the country of disbursement and field type verifications. If any error is encountered, the file is immediately rejected and the reason for rejection is displayed to the customer. The customer can make the necessary changes and upload the file again. Batch transactions can be originated from a ERP platform as well.\n\nIn the case of single transaction uploads through Wallet, WEB Form, or Mobile app, the data validations are done while the details are entered by the customer so that the modifications can be done immediately. \n\nIf an agent is sending transaction on behalf of an end user who is not a customer of the financial institution, then the agent needs to register the customer and get KYC clearance. The payment information can then be collected from the customer and payment process will be initiated. However, the payment will go out only upon approval of the KYC and approving the customer account. The registration will follow the individual user registration process.\n\nOnce the file is validated, the file is sent for compliance verification. If the compliance verification result returns a hit , then the compliance officer can remediate it (in case of false positive). The compliance officer then needs to either reject/verify the transaction. Compliance office will be able to view the details of the hit and make necessary entries to rectify the issue and approve the transactions. Such details can be reviewed in a later date for audit purpose.  (Compliance officer should be able to analyse transactions based on the sender transaction history, by country and by amount.) \n\nThe transaction is then sent to the Approver\u2019s queue for approval. The approver then validates the details given in the transaction and Approves/Rejects the transaction.\n\nThe transaction once approved goes to the queue of the authorizer. The authoriser checks the pre-fund balance and takes the decision to either authorise or reject the transaction. \n\nOnce authorized the transaction then goes to the disbursing party for disbursement. \n\nThe authorizer of the disbursing company can log in and check the list of transactions that have come in for disbursement. This user can either download the transaction files or directly initiate disbursement. The disbursing APIs are then called, and the transaction is disbursed to the end user. \n\nIn special scenarios when the associated financial organisation decided to bypass the compliance check, the payment instruction file is automatically moved to the approver queue.\n\nCompliance check will also be bypassed for frequent transaction initiators. If there is no change in the sender and receiver and the amount is within an allowed limit  then the check can be skipped                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\n\n\nTransaction can be initiated by Teller/ Agent/ Customer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransaction statuses\n\n\n\nStatus\n\nDescription\n\nTransaction Validated\n\nWhen a transaction file has been validated for mandatory fields and confirmed to be valid\n\nTransaction Rejected\n\nAfter validation, if the file is found to be invalid.\n\nCompliance check initiated\n\nWhen the file has been sent for compliance check\n\nCompliance HIT\n\nIf there has been a HIT upon compliance check\n\nCompliance remediated\n\nIf the compliance officer remediates the transaction\n\nCompliance Failed\n\nIf the compliance has been failed by the compliance officer.\n\nCompliance Passed\n\nIf the compliance is passed from the third-party application after compliance verification\n\nCompliance approved\n\nWhen the compliance user approves the transaction after compliance verification/ remediation\n\nTransaction Approved\n\nIf the Approver check the transaction and approves it\n\nApproval rejected\n\nIf the transaction approval is rejected by the Approver\n\nTransaction Authorised\n\nIf the Authoriser checks the transaction and authorises the transaction.\n\nAuthorisation rejected\n\nIf the transaction authorisation is rejected by the authoriser\n\nDisbursement initiated\n\nWhen the transaction is passed to the disbursement API for remittance to the end users\n\nDisbursement rejected\n\nIf the disbursement has been rejected by the disbursing partner due to any validation/ field issues\n\nDisbursement success\n\nIf the transaction has been disbursed successfully to the end user\n\nDisbursement failure\n\nIf the transaction disbursement failed due to reasons like invalid account etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nAudit Trail\n\n\n\nAn audit trail needs to be maintained of the complete flow of each transaction. Any user must be able to view the complete activities done on a transaction with time and user that has done the change. In the page listing the transactions, the audit trail can be placed as a button against each transaction in order to enable the user to view the details per transaction.\n\n\n\nPre-Loaded cards\n\n\n\nThe application must support the issuance of pre-loaded cards. The cards must be loaded with currency of any particular country and the card holder must be able to make local payments using the card. The application must be able to support funding of those cards from another country through payment instruction file.\n\n\n\nMulti Geography Support\n\n\n\nThe platform must be able to support payment initiation from and payment disbursement to any country around the world. In order to enable that, an intelligent routing rules engine must be created which would do the following \u2013\n\nValidations on the payment instruction file according to the country of disbursement. This would ensure that all the mandatory fields corresponding to a particular country are verified. \n\nThe routing logic must do a validation to see if the financial institution initiating the payment is licensed to take payment instruction from a customer in a specific state/country.\n\nA single initiator can be connected to multiple disbursing agents. Hence the routing must also be able to determine the disbursing agent based on the disbursing country given in the payment instruction file.\n\nIf there are multiple disbursing agents connected to an initiator for the same countries, the routing logic must be able to route taking into account the traffic in each route.\n\nThe routing logic must also support the selection of disbursement type. If a disbursing agent supports multiple disbursement types, then the authorizer should have the provision to select the preferred disbursement type before authorizing the payment instruction.\n\n\n\nReports\n\n\n\nThe application must give the user the provision to view/download the following reports.\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Name\n\nUser\n\nDescription\n\nGeneral Ledger Reports\n\n\n\nCompliance Officer\n\nAuthoriser\n\nApprover\n\nThis report would give a complete summary of all the transactions that have taken place for that company. This report can be filtered on the date, country and disbursing agent.\n\nBalance Reports\n\nAuthoriser\n\nApprover\n\nThis report is generated to understand the available balance in each prefund account. It should list the balance available in all the disbursing agents connected with the initiator.\n\nTransaction Reports \u2013\n\nTransaction Success Report\n\nTransaction Failure Report\n\nCompliance success report\n\nCompliance failure report\n\nAuthoriser\n\nApprover\n\nCompliance user\n\nTeller\n\n\n\nThis report details all statuses associated with transactions.\n\nAudit Log Report\n\nCompliance user\n\nAuthoriser\n\nApprover\n\nThis report gives the complete audit trail of all the transactions completed in a selected tenure.
